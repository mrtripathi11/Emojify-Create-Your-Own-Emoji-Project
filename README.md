# Emojify-Create-Your-Own-Emoji-Project
Generating Emojis Of Your Choice
Emojify

Turn your facial expression into an emoji.
Note

This project is still under development. Expect errors in recognition of emoji or other errors.
What we did here

    Decided what emojis to use.
    Stored 250 faces for each facial expression in a special way. The special way is that I took only the eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth of the face. Rest of the face is removed. (Only my face was used)
    Trained a CNN on these images.
    As of today there are 11 facial expressions. (Discussed later).

Outcome

Watch it here.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Tensorflow 1.5
    Keras
    OpenCV 3.4
    h5py
    A good grasp over the above 4 topics along with neural networks. Refer to the internet if you have problems with those. I myself am just a begineer in those.
    dlib
    A good CPU (preferably with a GPU).
    Patience.... A lot of it.
    Tensorboard (for visualizing training)

How to use this repo

This project would be completed done by us and us only. No one else helped us. 
The model is trained with  face only.
Here is what you can do. If you are a newbie to neural networks or machine learning please learn them. 
This guide contains a lot of technical stuff which you might find hard to understand.
